# 📊 Retail Data Warehouse & BI Dashboard

This repository contains an end-to-end BI solution built with Power BI, focused on sales and operations data from a global retailer.

## 🧠 Overview

This project was my first full-fledged experience with building an end-to-end BI dashboard using **real-world sales data**. Before this, I had worked with raw data and some dashboards, but this was the first time I built:

- A **star-schema data warehouse** from scratch
- Full integration of PostgreSQL and Excel data
- Interactive dashboards using **DAX measures** and layered visuals
- Real-time decision support tools with KPIs and forecasting

What I enjoyed most about this project was translating abstract business needs into data-driven visuals. Working on this gave me much more confidence in data storytelling, time-series forecasting, and breaking down business questions into measurable components.

It wasn’t just a technical exercise — it helped me think like a BI analyst.
