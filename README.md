# Retail BI Dashboard with Power BI 📊

A complete business intelligence solution built using Power BI, designed to extract insights from international retail sales data.

## 🧠 Overview
This was my first complete BI dashboard project where I built a star schema warehouse and used Power BI to explore seasonality, returns, and country-wise logistics performance.

What I found most exciting was turning raw sales data into actionable business stories. The experience helped me think more like a business analyst — working with DAX, data modeling, and building forecasts from scratch.
